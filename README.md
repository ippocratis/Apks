# Artifact Downloader
This is a script downloads any files from a github action extracts the apks from them and uploads them to your github releases.

## My Usecase
- I'm posting bitwarden apk's with mtls from https://github.com/oguzhane/nibblewarden in this using https://github.com/kaorlol/obtainium-artifact-downloader since oguzhane did not include releases but he provides the apk's in artifacts from GH actions.

- This way I can add this repo to https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium and get niblewarden updates and grab apk's.
